        <h2 class="large-text">A bit about myself...</h2>
        <p class="medium-text">I am currently the Deputy Head Boy at Ashfield Boys' High School, where I am working towards obtaining my A-levels. My subjects include Maths, Accounting, Business, and IT. Maths holds the top spot as my favourite subject because I love problem-solving. IT comes in a close second, particularly because of the practical units where we had the opportunity to create websites and design databases. Accounting is my most challenging subject as I have to do it outside of school hours since it is not officially offered by the school. This just makes it more fun for me, as I love learning and pushing myself!</p>
        <p class="medium-text">Since a young age, I have been deeply interested in computing and have greatly enjoyed learning about it. I am keen to enter the workplace as soon as possible, as I know that it would be an extremely enjoyable endeavour!</p>

            <p class="medium-text">This is a simple yet engaging game I made for the open night aimed at P6 and P7 students looking to come to my school to demonstrate what could be created in the coding club that I run for younger pupils after school!</p>

                <h3 class="medium-text">Pathway Opportunity Programme - Queenâ€™s University Belfast</h3>
                <p class="medium-text">This year-long programme gave me a look into University life and helped me better understand it. During the programme, I participated in a Summer School in which I was taught game development in Java and had to sit an exam to determine if I would get 0-2 grade reductions for a guaranteed conditional offer and ended up receiving 2 grade reductions!</p>

                <h3 class="medium-text">5 Day Work Experience - Generation Innovation</h3>
                <p class="medium-text">Myself and a diverse group of 8 were given a problem by a local Belfast company, Instil Software, and to solve it created an Edtech website using ChatGPTs API to give students a list of topics with descriptions based on a prompted subject. We also grew our social media from 0 to 200 followers in 5 days and used polls to better understand our target market!</p>

                <h3 class="medium-text">CodeCamp - Kainos</h3>
                <p class="medium-text">During the 5 day CodeCamp I was tasked with creating and presenting a website, I chose to create one on gaming and it was focused around giving simple tutorials and introductions to games, I also added quizzes for each game. This vastly improved my web development skills and got me hooked on HTML, CSS & JS. There were also some amazing talks that gave me further insight into the IT world.</p>

                <h3 class="medium-text">3 Day Work Experience - Kainos</h3>
                <p class="medium-text">I have completed a multitude of Kainos Work Experiences, in which I was put in groups of 3-4 and had to pick 2 words from a list of IT related words and make a website based on those, then go on to present it. This was really fun and further improved my teamwork, communication and people skills.</p>

                <h3 class="medium-text">Coding Club Creator - Ashfield Boys' High School</h3>
                <p class="medium-text">Having a passion for computing and programming for years made me realise that I wanted to share something so great and try to spark a passion within younger people. Therefore I created the coding club at my school, completely independently and made lesson plans, advertising graphics, brought on helpers and even spoke at assemblies to spread the word about the club.</p>

                <h3 class="medium-text">AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials Course</h3>
                <p class="medium-text">After an AWS talk at Kainos CodeCamp 2023 I was really integrated and later found AWS Skill Builder. I wanted to follow a course such as this one, as I felt this was a bit of a knowledge gap for me and also something that interested me. I was taught a great deal about AWS and was able to get a good understanding of its uses in the workplace and its benefits.</p>
