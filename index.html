      <p class="medium-text">
        I'm currently a Software Engineer at Kainos and a part-time Computing
        Systems student at Ulster University. My fascination with computing
        started at a young age, and I've been exploring new technologies and
        building innovative solutions ever since.

            Pathway Opportunity Programme - Queen’s University Belfast

          <p class="medium-text">
            This year-long programme gave me a look into University life and
            helped me better understand it. During the programme, I participated
            in a Summer School in which I was taught game development in Java
            and had to sit an exam to determine if I would get 0-2 grade
            reductions for a guaranteed conditional offer and ended up receiving
            2 grade reductions!

            Myself and a diverse group of 8 were given a problem by a local
            Belfast company, Instil Software, and to solve it created an Edtech
            website using ChatGPTs API to give students a list of topics with
            descriptions based on a prompted subject. We also grew our social
            media from 0 to 200 followers in 5 days and used polls to better
            understand our target market!

            During the 5 day CodeCamp I was tasked with creating and presenting
            a website, I chose to create one on gaming and it was focused around
            giving simple tutorials and introductions to games, I also added
            quizzes for each game. This vastly improved my web development
            skills and got me hooked on HTML, CSS & JS. There were also some
            amazing talks that gave me further insight into the IT world.

            related words and make a website based on those, then go on to
            present it. This was really fun and further improved my teamwork,
            communication and people skills.

            Coding Club Creator - Ashfield Boys' High School
          </h3>
          <p class="medium-text">
            Having a passion for computing and programming for years made me
            realise that I wanted to share something so great and try to spark a
            passion within younger people. Therefore I created the coding club
            at my school, completely independently and made lesson plans,
            advertising graphics, brought on helpers and even spoke at
            assemblies to spread the word about the club.

            After an AWS talk at Kainos CodeCamp 2023 I was really intrigued and
            later found AWS Skill Builder. I wanted to follow a course such as
            this one, as I felt this was a bit of a knowledge gap for me and
            also something that interested me. I was taught a great deal about
            AWS and was able to get a good understanding of its uses in the
            workplace and its benefits.

          <h3 class="medium-text">Kainos Employment</h3>
          <p class="medium-text">
            I joined Kainos after leaving school through the Earn As You Learn
            scheme. It has been very rewarding and I have met many nice people,
            while vastly improving my software engineer capabilities!
          </p>

          <p class="medium-text">
            After joining Kainos, I was immediately placed into a team of eight,
            all of us participating in the Earn As You Learn scheme. Together,
            we embarked on a 16-week engineering academy where we were
            introduced to the fundamentals of software engineering. Rather than
            focusing on specific programming languages, the academy emphasised
            learning how to think critically and solve problems as a
            developer—teaching us to programme, not just code.
          </p>
          <p class="medium-text">
            We started with the data layer, using MySQL to design and manage
            databases. After presenting our work, we moved on to the logic
            layer, where we developed backend functionality using Java. Finally,
            we tackled the presentation layer, creating user interfaces with
            TypeScript and Nunjucks. Along the way, we also learned automated
            testing, covering unit tests, integration tests, and UI testing. We
            explored accessibility testing using Pa11y and performance testing
            with JMeter, which gave us a deeper understanding of how to ensure
            quality and scalability in our work. The academy culminated in a
            two-week project where we built a job application website, combining
            all the skills we had learned throughout the course. The tickets
            were assigned to us, and we successfully delivered the MVP.
          </p>
          <p class="medium-text">
            In addition to our core learning, we had the privilege of attending
            amazing talks from skilled professionals within the company. Their
            insights and experiences were incredibly inspiring. We also
            participated in workshops run by these experts, which helped us
            deepen our knowledge on specific topics and further refine our
            skills.
          </p>
          <p class="medium-text">
            Presenting our project to senior staff was nerve-racking, but
            everyone was so lovely and encouraging. Their support made me
            realise my anxiety was completely unnecessary.
          </p>
          <p class="medium-text">
            Looking back, I’m incredibly proud of my progress during the
            academy. I’ve never had so much fun learning, and I feel like I
            gained an incredible amount from the experience. We achieved so much
            in just 16 weeks, and I even surprised myself with what I was
            capable of.
