            computing started at a young age, and I've been exploring new
            technologies and building innovative solutions ever since.

              I joined Kainos after leaving school through the Earn As You Learn
              scheme. It has been very rewarding and I have met many nice
              people, while vastly improving my software engineer capabilities!
            </p>

            <p class="medium-text">
              After joining Kainos, I was immediately placed into a team of
              eight, all of us participating in the Earn As You Learn scheme.
              Together, we embarked on a 16-week engineering academy where we
              were introduced to the fundamentals of software engineering.
              Rather than focusing on specific programming languages, the
              academy emphasised learning how to think critically and solve
              problems as a developer—teaching us to programme, not just code.
            </p>
            <p class="medium-text">
              We started with the data layer, using MySQL to design and manage
              databases. After presenting our work, we moved on to the logic
              layer, where we developed backend functionality using Java.
              Finally, we tackled the presentation layer, creating user
              interfaces with TypeScript and Nunjucks. Along the way, we also
              learned automated testing, covering unit tests, integration tests,
              and UI testing. We explored accessibility testing using Pa11y and
              performance testing with JMeter, which gave us a deeper
              understanding of how to ensure quality and scalability in our
              work. The academy culminated in a two-week project where we built
              a job application website, combining all the skills we had learned
              throughout the course. The tickets were assigned to us, and we
              successfully delivered the MVP.
            </p>
            <p class="medium-text">
              In addition to our core learning, we had the privilege of
              attending amazing talks from skilled professionals within the
              company. Their insights and experiences were incredibly inspiring.
              We also participated in workshops run by these experts, which
              helped us deepen our knowledge on specific topics and further
              refine our skills.
            </p>
            <p class="medium-text">
              Presenting our project to senior staff was nerve-racking, but
              everyone was so lovely and encouraging. Their support made me
              realise my anxiety was completely unnecessary.
            </p>
            <p class="medium-text">
              Looking back, I'm incredibly proud of my progress during the
              academy. I've never had so much fun learning, and I feel like I
              gained an incredible amount from the experience. We achieved so
              much in just 16 weeks, and I even surprised myself with what I was
              capable of.

              such as this one, as I felt this was a bit of a knowledge gap for
              me and also something that interested me. I was taught a great
              deal about AWS and was able to get a good understanding of its
              uses in the workplace and its benefits.

              Having a passion for computing and programming for years made me
              realise that I wanted to share something so great and try to spark
              a passion within younger people. Therefore I created the coding
              club at my school, completely independently and made lesson plans,
              advertising graphics, brought on helpers and even spoke at
              assemblies to spread the word about the club.

              I have completed a multitude of Kainos Work Experiences, in which
              I was put in groups of 3-4 and had to pick 2 words from a list of
              IT related words and make a website based on those, then go on to
              present it. This was really fun and further improved my teamwork,
              communication and people skills.

              During the 5 day CodeCamp I was tasked with creating and
              presenting a website, I chose to create one on gaming and it was
              focused around giving simple tutorials and introductions to games,
              I also added quizzes for each game. This vastly improved my web
              development skills and got me hooked on HTML, CSS & JS. There were
              also some amazing talks that gave me further insight into the IT
              world.

              Myself and a diverse group of 8 were given a problem by a local

              This year-long programme gave me a look into University life and
              helped me better understand it. During the programme, I
              participated in a Summer School in which I was taught game
              development in Java and had to sit an exam to determine if I would
              get 0-2 grade reductions for a guaranteed conditional offer and
              ended up receiving 2 grade reductions!
