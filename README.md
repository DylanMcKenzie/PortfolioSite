# PortfolioSite
This project showcases my personal work and endeavours while helping me improve my web development skills. It started as a learning project to explore HTML and CSS, and I plan to evolve it further with modern technologies. I believe that learning the fundamentals is key, so I plan to take my time during the transition and make the most of what I'm using now.

## Current Development Goals
Here are the current objectives I’m working on to improve and expand the project:

1. **Enhance Mobile Support**:
   - Refine the responsive design to ensure the site looks good on any device

2. **Move to React**:
   - Transition the website from static HTML/CSS to a React
   - Learn and implement React best practices

## Future Ideas
Here are some potential features and improvements I’d like to explore:
- Add a dark mode toggle
- Include animations and transitions for a smoother UX
- Expand the portfolio section with detailed project descriptions
